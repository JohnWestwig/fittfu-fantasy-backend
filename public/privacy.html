    <h2>Where I store your personal information</h2>
    <p>
        If you are located outside the United States, the information that I collect from you may be transferred to, 
        and stored and processed at, a destination in the United States. By submitting information, you agree to this transfer,

    <h2>Is the personal information secure?</h2>
    <p>
        Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and 
        Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your device and 
        by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. I endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information 
        I hold in my records, but I cannot guarantee complete security. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. 
        Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 
        When you enter your information I encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security (TLS). The app may contain 
        links to other sites. I are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site 
        you should read that site's privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>What choices do I have? </h2>
    <p>
        You can always opt not to disclose information to me, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with me or to take advantage of some of my special features. 
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        I may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information I collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. 
        If I make material changes or changes in the way I use Personal Information, I will notify you by sending you an email prior to the change 
        becoming effective. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the app after such changes have been first posted.
